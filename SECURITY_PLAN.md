# Security and Compliance Plan for ONYE-AI-FHIR System

This document outlines the proposed security and compliance measures to ensure the ONYE-AI-FHIR system adheres to HIPAA regulations and securely handles Protected Health Information (PHI) within FHIR data.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms

To ensure only authorized users and systems can access FHIR data, the following mechanisms will be implemented:

* **OAuth 2.0:** This industry-standard protocol will be used for delegated authorization, allowing users to grant third-party applications (like our ONYE-AI-FHIR frontend) limited access to their FHIR resources without sharing their credentials directly.
* **SMART on FHIR:** As an open standard built on OAuth 2.0, SMART on FHIR is specifically designed for healthcare applications to integrate seamlessly with Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. It provides robust authentication and authorization flows tailored for clinical workflows, ensuring secure patient- and user-context launch of applications.
    * **User Authentication:** Users will authenticate against an Identity Provider (IdP) integrated with the EHR or a dedicated user management system.
    * **Application Authorization:** The ONYE-AI-FHIR application will request specific scopes (e.g., `patient/*.read`, `profile`, `openid`) from the FHIR server, and the user will consent to these permissions. Access tokens issued will be short-lived and refreshed using refresh tokens.
* **Backend API Key/Token Authentication:** For server-to-server communication (e.g., our Python backend communicating with a real FHIR server or other internal services), secure API keys or mTLS (mutual TLS) will be used to authenticate the backend service itself.

## 2. Data Privacy and Audit Logging Strategy

Protecting PHI and maintaining an immutable record of access are paramount for HIPAA compliance.

* **Data Encryption:**
    * **Data in Transit:** All communication between the frontend, backend, and FHIR server will be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS). This prevents eavesdropping and tampering.
    * **Data at Rest:** FHIR data, whether in databases or file storage, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256). This applies to any temporary storage or caching within our system.
* **Minimal Data Exposure:** The system will operate on the principle of least privilege regarding data access. Only the necessary FHIR resources and data elements required to fulfill a query will be retrieved and processed.
* **De-identification/Anonymization (when appropriate):** For certain analytical or research purposes where direct patient identification is not required, data de-identification techniques will be explored and applied before processing or storage.
* **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all data access, modifications, and system interactions.
    * **Logged Information:** Each log entry will include:
        * Timestamp of the event.
        * User identity (e.g., User ID, system ID).
        * Action performed (e.g., "query patient data", "access condition resource").
        * Resource accessed (e.g., `Patient/123`, `Condition/456`).
        * Outcome of the action (success/failure).
        * Source IP address.
    * **Log Management:** Logs will be:
        * Stored securely in a centralized, immutable log management system.
        * Protected from unauthorized access and tampering.
        * Retained for a period compliant with regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA).
        * Regularly reviewed for suspicious activities or breaches.

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Considerations

RBAC is crucial for fine-grained control over who can access what data within the system.

* **Integration with EHR/IdP Roles:** The system will leverage existing role definitions from the EHR or enterprise Identity Provider where possible. For instance, a "clinician" role might have read access to all patient data, while a "researcher" role might only have access to de-identified datasets.
* **Granular Permissions:** Permissions will be defined based on roles and the specific FHIR resource types and operations (e.g., `read`, `write`, `search`). For example:
    * A doctor might have `Patient.read`, `Condition.read`, `MedicationRequest.write`.
    * An administrative assistant might only have `Patient.read` (limited fields) and `Appointment.write`.
* **Context-Based Access:** SMART on FHIR allows for context-based access, meaning permissions can be dynamically adjusted based on the current patient context (e.g., an application launched for a specific patient can only access that patient's data).
* **Least Privilege Principle:** Users and systems will be granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform their designated functions. Permissions will be reviewed periodically and adjusted as roles and responsibilities change.
* **Separation of Duties:** Where applicable, critical functions will be separated among different roles to prevent a single individual from having too much control.

By implementing these measures, the ONYE-AI-FHIR system aims to provide a secure and compliant environment for handling sensitive healthcare data.
